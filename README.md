##INTRODUCTION

Built with PHP (7.09)<br>
**unPOSTer** is a tiny API which prevents form reposting on page refresh. It basically stops you from encountering a re-POST alert prompt. Moreover, it comes with 3 methods that makes it a lil' adjustable - for example whether you would like to keep posted data after refresh or not.
